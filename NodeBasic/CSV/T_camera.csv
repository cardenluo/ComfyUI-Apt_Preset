大特写 Detail Shot,"detail shot style {prompt}. Extreme close - up of a specific object or part, highlighting fine details, textures, and minute features","Overall view of the whole object or scene, lack of detailed focus"
群景 Scenery Shot,"scenery shot style {prompt}. A wide - angle view of a group of elements, a landscape, or a collection of objects, showing the overall setting and relationships between them","Single - object focus, close - up of a single element, lack of a group or scenery context"
特写 Close - Up,"close - up style {prompt}. A focused view of a particular object or part, magnifying it to show important details, expressions, or features","General view of the whole, long - distance view, view with many elements not focused on the特写 subject"
背景虚化 Foreground,"foreground style {prompt}. The foreground object is in sharp focus while the background is blurred, creating a sense of depth and drawing attention to the foreground","Both foreground and background in equal focus, background in sharp focus with foreground blurred, no depth - of - field effect"
产品视图 Product View,"product view style {prompt}. A clear, well - lit, and detailed view of a product, highlighting its features, shape, and details, often with a clean background","Cluttered view, low - quality view, view not emphasizing product features"
近距离景 Tight Shot,"tight shot style {prompt}. A close - up view that tightly frames the subject, showing only a small area around the main object, emphasizing its details and presence","Wide - angle view, long - shot view, view with a lot of empty space around the subject"
俯视视角 Top - down perspective,"top - down perspective style {prompt}. View from above, looking down on the subject or scene, showing the layout, arrangement, and relationships from a bird's - eye view","Bottom - up perspective, eye - level perspective, view from below"
仰视 Look Up,"look up style {prompt}. View from below, looking up at the subject, creating a sense of grandeur or emphasizing the height and scale of the object","View from above, eye - level perspective, looking down"
鸟瞰视角 Bird's - eye,"bird's - eye style {prompt}. A high - altitude view similar to a bird's perspective, showing a large area, landscape, or complex layout in a comprehensive way","Ground - level view, close - up view, view with limited scope"
透视视角 Perspective,"perspective style {prompt}. A view that accurately represents the three - dimensional space, with objects appearing smaller in the distance and following the rules of linear perspective","Flat view without perspective, distorted perspective, incorrect depth representation"
"前视、侧视、后视图 Front, Side, Rear View","front/side/rear view style {prompt}. A clear and unobstructed view of the front/side/rear of the subject, showing the specific features and details of that particular side","View from other angles, obscured view of the specified side, view with elements blocking the side"
全景视 Panoramic view,"panoramic view style {prompt}. A wide - angle, sweeping view that captures a large portion of the surrounding environment, providing a broad and immersive view","Narrow view, close - up view, view with limited horizontal or vertical scope"
对称构图 Symmetrical Composition,"symmetrical composition style {prompt}. The image is evenly divided, with elements on one side mirroring those on the other. This creates a sense of balance, stability, and harmony, often used in architecture, formal portraits, or religious art. For example, a building with identical facades on either side of a central axis","Asymmetrical, unbalanced layout, lack of mirror - image elements, chaotic arrangement of components"
三分法构图 Rule of Thirds,"rule of thirds style {prompt}. The frame is divided into nine equal parts by two horizontal and two vertical lines. Placing key elements at the intersection points or along these lines can create a visually appealing and balanced composition, guiding the viewer's eye. A landscape with the horizon along one of the horizontal lines and a focal point like a tree at an intersection","Centered, un - proportioned placement of elements, lack of division into thirds and utilization of intersection points"
中心构图 Central Composition,"central composition style {prompt}. The main subject is placed at the center of the frame, drawing immediate attention. It is a simple and direct way to emphasize the subject, often used in product photography or when the subject is the sole focus, such as a single flower in a still - life","Off - center, dispersed subject placement, lack of a clear central focus"
引导线构图 Leading Lines,"leading lines style {prompt}. Lines within the image, such as roads, rivers, or architectural elements, lead the viewer's eye towards the main subject or a point of interest. This adds depth and a sense of movement to the composition, like a winding path leading to a cottage in the distance","Random, unconnected lines, lack of lines that guide the eye, no clear visual flow"
框架式构图 Frame - within - a - Frame,"frame - within - a - frame style {prompt}. A frame, like a window, doorway, or natural elements like tree branches, surrounds the main subject. This technique adds depth, draws attention to the subject, and can create a sense of context, such as a view of a landscape through a window frame","Open, unframed composition, lack of a surrounding structure to enclose the subject, no depth - adding framing elements"
前景构图 Foreground Composition,"foreground composition style {prompt}. The foreground contains prominent elements that add depth and context to the image. The foreground elements can be in focus or slightly blurred, with the main subject in the middle or background, like a field of flowers in the foreground with a mountain in the distance","Lack of foreground elements, over - emphasis on the middle or background, no depth - creating foreground objects"
三角形构图 Triangular Composition,"triangular composition style {prompt}. The main elements of the image form a triangle, either explicitly or implicitly. This creates a sense of stability, balance, and visual interest, often used in group portraits or landscapes with mountains and valleys forming a triangular shape","Shapeless, non - triangular arrangements, lack of a triangular structure among elements, unbalanced forms"
放射性构图 Radial Composition,"radial composition style {prompt}. Elements radiate out from a central point, creating a sense of energy, movement, and dynamism. It can draw the viewer's eye to the center and then outwards, like the spokes of a wheel or rays of sunlight","Linear, non - radial arrangements, lack of a central point with radiating elements, static and non - dynamic compositions"
留白构图 Negative Space,"negative space style {prompt}. A significant amount of empty space (negative space) is used in the image, which can make the main subject stand out, create a sense of simplicity, and allow the viewer's mind to focus on the subject. A single bird flying against a large, clear sky","Cluttered, over - filled composition, lack of empty space, no emphasis on simplicity through negative space"
倾斜构图 Diagonal Composition,"diagonal composition style {prompt}. Elements are arranged along a diagonal line, which adds a sense of movement, instability, and drama to the image. It can make the viewer's eye move quickly across the frame, like a skateboarder on a ramp creating a diagonal line","Horizontal or vertical, static arrangements, lack of diagonal lines to introduce movement, stable and un - dramatic compositions"
